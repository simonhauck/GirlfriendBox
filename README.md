# GirlfriendBox_Present
This is a self-made present for your girlfriend or wife.

It is a box, that counts how long you have been together or married in different units. It cycles through seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years as well as a customizable text, that shows your “Date”. Additionally, it also displays the current date & time at the bottom of the display. 

The project is inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbRNsSK7r4M).

## What you need
- 1 Arduino, which is the "brain". I used the Arduino Nano V3
- 1 Real-Time-Clock Module, which keeps track of the time. I used the DS3231
- 1 LCD-Dispaly with 20 * 4 characters
- 3 Buttons to set the current time
- 2 Switches. The first is for power and the second for the backlicht of the display
- Optionally
  - 1 Lipo-Battery, so that you don't require always a power cable. I used a model with 3.7V and 2600mAh
  - 1 Lipo-Charging-Circuit, so that you can charge the battery 
  - 1 Boost-Converter, which increases the battery voltage to 7 Volts
  - Some soldering gear, if you want to make a nice PCB
